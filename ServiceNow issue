ServiceNow Import fail issue "Repository authentication failed, check credentials. Make sure the user has both read and write access"


In fact GitHub must have changed something. Username/password is no longer accepted as a credential. The solution was to create an access token in GitHub 
and use it as the password within ServiceNow.

1. Go to github.com
2. Navigate to "Settings"
3. Navigate to "Developer"
4. Create a new token
5. Enter the created token as the password within the credentials used for GitHub in ServiceNow
